      <p>We explore... and you call us criminals.</p>
      <p>We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals.</p>
      <p>
        We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious
        bias... and you call us criminals.
      </p>
      <p>Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity.</p>
      <p>
        My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what
        they look like.
      </p>
      <p>
        My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never
        forgive me for.
      </p>
      <p>I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.</p>
