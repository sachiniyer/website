  </head>
  <body>
		<p>You can send me an email through google if you would like, but I would encourage you to encrypt the message with my <a href="https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=hget&search=dc0b988ca23a9d9e46ee4b355887e8f9">public key</a>. If you don't that is okay, but I think it is worth taking a look at.</p>
