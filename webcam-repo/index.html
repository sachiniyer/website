      This is a basic webstreaming done from a camera on a raspberry pi in new york that is connected through reverse ssh tunneling to a server in california through ffmpeg and matroska containers that is then delivered to you. Even at 10 frames per second there is massive latency, so you're not going to see your command for a while. WASD to move.
