# Intro

My name is Sachin. I recently graduated from NYU and am currently working as a Software Engineer.

# Computer Science Interests

I am not really sure exactly what I am interested in yet, but you should check my [projects page](/projects) for what I am doing right now. I have done stuff all over computer science, but am generally trending towards more theoretical computer science right now.

Mostly, I am interested in any cool problem that comes across my computer screen.

# Hobbies

### Jazz
I like Jazz, quite a bit. I played trombone and the keyboard in high school. Some of my historically favorite albums are [Duke Ellington & John Coltrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Ellington_%26_John_Coltrane), [The Shape of Jazz to Come](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shape_of_Jazz_to_Come), [Return to Forever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Forever_(Chick_Corea_album)), and [The Buffering Cocoon](https://www.nowvsnow.com/).

### Coffee
I also like coffee. My favorite roasters right now are [Devocion](https://www.devocion.com/) in New York, [Chromatic](https://www.chromaticcoffee.com/) in San Jose, and [Herkimer](https://herkimercoffee.com/) in Seattle. I mostly drink v60s.

### Biking
Lastly, I really enjoy commuting by bike. It is super fun and good exercise.
