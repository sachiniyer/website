# Hobbies

### Jazz

I like Jazz, quite a bit. I played trombone and the keyboard in high school. Some of my historically favorite albums are [Duke Ellington & John Coltrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Ellington_%26_John_Coltrane), [The Shape of Jazz to Come](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shape_of_Jazz_to_Come), [Return to Forever](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Forever_(Chick_Corea_album)>), and [The Buffering Cocoon](https://www.nowvsnow.com/).

### Coffee

My favorite roasters right now are [Devocion](https://www.devocion.com/) in New York, [Chromatic](https://www.chromaticcoffee.com/) in San Jose, and [Herkimer](https://herkimercoffee.com/) in Seattle.

### Biking

Lastly, I really enjoy commuting by [bike](https://bikehistory.org/bikes/sprint/). [Walkable cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15-minute_city) are the best.
